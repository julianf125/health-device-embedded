# Embedded Code for Wearable Health Monitor

## Description
The code in this repository was developed in the course of my role as Embedded Systems Lead for my Computer Engineering Capstone Project at UC Santa Barbara. In this project, my team and I were tasked with developing the circuitry and firmware for a wearable health monitor in the form of a smartwatch, as well as an Android application to receive and analyze data collected by the health monitor and upload it to a cloud database. This firmware was written to run on the smartwatch, collecting data from all onboard sensors and transmitting it to our Android application (the implementation of which is found in the health-device-Android repository pinned on my profile).
